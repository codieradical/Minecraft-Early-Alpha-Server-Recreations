# Minecraft Early Alpha Server Recreations
## Servers

*Development begins*
- Alpha 1.0.5
- Alpha 1.0.6
- Alpha 1.0.7
- Alpha 1.0.8
- Alpha 1.0.9

*Private Testing Begins*

- Alpha 1.0.10
- Alpha 1.0.11
- Alpha 1.0.12
- Alpha 1.0.13
- Alpha 1.0.14

*Server software is release publicly.*

These servers were made based on Alpha Server 0.1.0 (for Alpha 1.0.15).
Any version from Alpha 1.0.5 to Alpha 1.0.14 is supported.
Alpha 1.0.15 is when server jars were release by Mojang.
Any _0x version is compatible with the same patch version. (eg, a1.0.6_03 can join an a1.0.6 server).

## Known Issues
- Alpha 1.0.5 is basically useless, it loads the world but nothing else. You can't see other players, or what they do. You could use it to host a parkour map I guess.
- Some clients behave weirdly with spawn protection.
- Some really early clients have problems rendering distant chunks, hit F to cycle your fog to fix this.
- Chat was implemented in Alpha 1.0.10. Any older version doesn't have chat, and since furnaces don't work you can't use /iron, so there's no way to get iron.
- Doors are glitchy, especially before a1.0.9.

## Playing
Since these versions don't have a direct connect screen, you'll need to use a custom launcher to join servers.
Any good launcher supports it, I'd recommend [MineOnline](https://mineonline.codie.gg/)
