# Minecraft Early Alpha Server Recreations
## Servers

*Development begins*
- Alpha 1.0.5
  - This client has barely any netcode and crashes almost instantly.
- Alpha 1.0.6
- Alpha 1.0.7
- Alpha 1.0.8
- Alpha 1.0.9

*Private Testing Begins*

- Alpha 1.0.10
- Alpha 1.0.11
- Alpha 1.0.12
- Alpha 1.0.13
- Alpha 1.0.14

*Server software is release publicly.*

## Playing
Since these versions don't have a direct connect screen, you'll need to use a custom launcher to join servers.
Any good launcher supports it, I'd recommend [MineOnline](https://mineonline.codie.gg/)

These servers were made based on Alpha Server 0.1.0 (for Alpha 1.0.15).
Any version from Alpha 1.0.6 to Alpha 1.0.14 is supported.
Alpha 1.0.15 is when server jars were release by Mojang, Alpha 1.0.5 doesn't have enough netcode (I tried).
Any _0x version is compatible with the same minor version. (eg, a1.0.6_03 can join an a1.0.6 server).

## Known Issues
- The server GUI is broken. Just doesn't show anything, use the terminal instead.
- Some clients behave weirdly with spawn protection. I may add an option to turn it off in future.
- Some really early clients have problems rendering distant chunks, hit F to cycle your fog to fix this.
- Chat was implemented in Alpha 1.0.10. Any older version doesn't have chat, and since furnaces don't work and you can't use /iron, there's no way to get iron.
- The give command doesn't work in versions older than 1.0.10, I will remove it ultimately.
