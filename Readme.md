# Minecraft Early Alpha Server Recreations
## Servers

*Development begins*
- Alpha 1.0.5*
- Alpha 1.0.6
- Alpha 1.0.7
- Alpha 1.0.8
- Alpha 1.0.9

*Private Testing Begins*

- Alpha 1.0.10
- Alpha 1.0.11
- Alpha 1.0.12
- Alpha 1.0.13
- Alpha 1.0.14

*Server software is release publicly.*

\* In Alpha 1.0.5, there's barely any netcode. Nothing I can do about that with the server. You can't see other players or what they do, only the world. Could be useful for parkour maps.

## Playing
Since these versions don't have a direct connect screen, you'll need to use a custom launcher to join servers.
Any good launcher supports it, I'd recommend [MineOnline](https://mineonline.codie.gg/)

These servers were made based on Alpha Server 0.1.0 (for Alpha 1.0.15).
Any version from Alpha 1.0.6 to Alpha 1.0.14 is supported.
Alpha 1.0.15 is when server jars were release by Mojang, Alpha 1.0.5 doesn't have enough netcode (I tried).
Any _0x version is compatible with the same minor version. (eg, a1.0.6_03 can join an a1.0.6 server).

## Known Issues
- Pre 1.0.10, Mining blocks within the spawn protection will produce drops but not destroy the block.
- Pre 1.0.9, clients have problems rendering distant chunks, hit F to cycle your fog to fix this.
- Pre 1.0.10, chat isn't implemented and since furnaces don't work and you can't use /iron, there's no way to get iron.
