# Minecraft Early Alpha Server Recreations
## Servers

*Development begins*
- Alpha 1.0.5
  - This client has barely any netcode and crashes almost instantly.
- Alpha 1.0.6
- Alpha 1.0.7
- Alpha 1.0.8
- Alpha 1.0.9

*Private Testing Begins*

- Alpha 1.0.10
- Alpha 1.0.11
- Alpha 1.0.12
- Alpha 1.0.13
- Alpha 1.0.14

*Server software is release publicly.*

## Playing
Since these versions don't have a direct connect screen, you'll need to use a custom launcher to join servers.
Any good launcher supports it, I'd recommend [MineOnline](https://mineonline.codie.gg/)

These servers were made based on Alpha Server 0.1.0 (for Alpha 1.0.15).
Any version from Alpha 1.0.6 to Alpha 1.0.14 is supported.
Alpha 1.0.15 is when server jars were release by Mojang, Alpha 1.0.5 doesn't have enough netcode (I tried).
Any _0x version is compatible with the same minor version. (eg, a1.0.6_03 can join an a1.0.6 server).

## Known Issues
- The server GUI is broken. Just doesn't show anything, use the terminal instead.
- In some really early versions, right clicking the ground with items can spawn different blocks. This is a client issue and cannot be fixed.
- Pre 1.0.10, Mining blocks within the spawn protection will produce drops but not destroy the block.
- Pre 1.0.9, clients have problems rendering distant chunks, hit F to cycle your fog to fix this.
- Pre 1.0.10, chat isn't implemented and since furnaces don't work and you can't use /iron, there's no way to get iron*.
  - There's actually a really convoluted way to get iron in old versions. Hoe some grass, it'll spawn wool. Make cloth boots, right click, it'll spawn iron blocks. Mine em with a stone pick.
